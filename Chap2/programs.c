// (a) If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a
// program to calculate the sum of its digits. (Hint: Use the modulus
// operator ‘%’)
// (b) If a five-digit number is input through the keyboard, write a
// program to reverse the number.
// (c) If lengths of three sides of a triangle are input through the
// keyboard, write a program to find the area of the triangle.
// (d) Write a program to receive Cartesian co-ordinates (x, y) of a point
// and convert them into polar co-ordinates (r, ).
// Hint: r = sqrt ( x2
// + y2
// ) and tan-1
// ( y / x )
// (e) Write a program to receive values of latitude (L1, L2) and longitude
// (G1, G2), in degrees, of two places on the earth and output the
// distance (D) between them in nautical miles. The formula for
// distance in nautical miles is:
// D = 3963 cos
// -1
// ( sin L1 sin L2 + cos L1 cos L2 * cos ( G2 – G1 ) )
// (f) Wind chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to
// wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air
// temperature, and is calculated as per the following formula:
// wcf = 35.74 + 0.6215t + ( 0.4275t - 35.75 ) * v
// 0.16
// where t is the temperature and v is the wind velocity. Write a
// program to receive values of t and v and calculate wind chill factor
// (wcf).
// (g) If value of an angle is input through the keyboard, write a program
// to print all its Trigonometric ratios.
// (h) Two numbers are input through the keyboard into two locations C
// and D. Write a program to interchange the contents of C and D.
// (i) Consider a currency system in which there are notes of seven
// denominations, namely, Re. 1, Rs. 2, Rs. 5, Rs. 10, Rs. 50, Rs. 100. If
// a sum of Rs. N is entered through the keyboard, write a program to
// compute the smallest number of notes that will combine to give Rs.
