// (a) Write a program to print all prime numbers from 1 to 300. (Hint:
// Use nested loops, break and continue)
// (b) Write a program to fill the entire screen with a smiling face. The
// smiling face has an ASCII value 1.
// (c) Write a program to add first seven terms of the following series
// using a for loop:
// (d) Write a program to generate all combinations of 1, 2 and 3 using for
// loop.
// (e) A machine is purchased which will produce earning of Rs. 1000 per
// year while it lasts. The machine costs Rs. 6000 and will have a
// salvage value of Rs. 2000 when it is condemned. If 9 percent per
// annum can be earned on alternate investments, write a program to
// determine what will be the minimum life of the machine to make it
// a more attractive investment compared to alternative investment?
// (c) Write a program to print the multiplication table of the number
// entered by the user. The table should get displayed in the
// following form:
// 29 * 1 = 29
// 29 * 2 = 58
// â€¦
// (f) According to a study, the approximate level of intelligence of a
// person can be calculated using the following formula:
// i = 2 + ( y + 0.5 x )
// Write a program that will produce a table of values of i, y and x,
// where y varies from 1 to 6, and, for each value of y, x varies from
// 5.5 to 12.5 in steps of 0.5.
// (g) When interest compounds q times per year at an annual rate of
// r % for n years, the principal p compounds to an amount a as per
// the following formula
// a = p ( 1 + r / q ) nq
// Write a program to read 10 sets of p, r, n & q and calculate the
// corresponding as.
// (i) Write a program to generate all Pythogorean Triplets with side
// length less than or equal to 30.
// (j) Population of a town today is 100000. The population has increased
// steadily at the rate of 10 % per year for last 10 years. Write a
// program to determine the population at the end of each year in the
// last decade.
// (k) Ramanujan number is the smallest number that can be expressed
// as sum of two cubes in two different ways. Write a program to print
// all such numbers up to a reasonable limit.
// (l) Write a program to print 24 hours of day with suitable suffixes like
// AM, PM, Noon and Midnight.
// (m) Write a program to produce the following output:
//    1
//   2 3
//  4 5 6
// 7 8 9 10
// (n) Write a program to produce the following output:
// A B C D E F G F E D C B A
// A B C D E F   F E D C B A
// A B C D E       E D C B A
// A B C D           D C B A
// A B C               C B A
// A B                   B A
// A                       A
// (o) Write a program to produce the following output:
//         1
//       1   1
//     1   2   1
//   1  3    3   1
// 1  4   6    4    1
