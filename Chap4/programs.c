// (a) Any year is entered through the keyboard, write a program to
// determine whether the year is leap or not. Use the logical operators
// && and ||.
// (c) A certain grade of steel is graded according to the following
// conditions:
// (i) Hardness must be greater than 50
// (ii) Carbon content must be less than 0.7
// (iii) Tensile strength must be greater than 5600
// The grades are as follows:
// Grade is 10 if all three conditions are met
// Grade is 9 if conditions (i) and (ii) are met
// Grade is 8 if conditions (ii) and (iii) are met
// Grade is 7 if conditions (i) and (iii) are met
// Grade is 6 if only one condition is met
// Grade is 5 if none of the conditions are met
// Write a program, which will require the user to give values of
// hardness, carbon content and tensile strength of the steel under
// consideration and output the grade of the steel.
// (d) If the three sides of a triangle are entered through the keyboard,
// write a program to check whether the triangle is valid or not. The
// triangle is valid if the sum of two sides is greater than the largest of
// the three sides.
// (e) If the three sides of a triangle are entered through the keyboard,
// write a program to check whether the triangle is isosceles,
// equilateral, scalene or right angled triangle.
// (a) Using conditional operators determine:
// (1) Whether the character entered through the keyboard is a
// lower case alphabet or not.
// (2) Whether a character entered through the keyboard is a special
// symbol or not.
// (b) Write a program using conditional operators to determine whether
// a year entered through the keyboard is a leap year or not.
// (c) Write a program to find the greatest of the three numbers entered
// through the keyboard. Use conditional operators.
// (d) Write a program to receive value of an angle in degrees and check
// whether sum of squares of sine and cosine of this angle is equal to
// (e) Rewrite the following program using conditional operators.
// # include <stdio.h>
// int main( )
// {
// float sal ;
// printf ( "Enter the salary" ) ;
// scanf ( "%f", &sal ) ;
// if ( sal >= 25000 && sal <= 40000 )
// printf ( "Manager\n" ) ;
// else
// if ( sal >= 15000 && sal < 25000 )
// printf ( "Accountant\n" ) ;
