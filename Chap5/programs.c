// (a) Write a program to calculate overtime pay of 10 employees.
// Overtime is paid at the rate of Rs. 12.00 per hour for every hour
// worked above 40 hours. Assume that employees do not work for
// fractional part of an hour.
// (b) Write a program to find the factorial value of any number entered
// through the keyboard.
// (c) Two numbers are entered through the keyboard. Write a program
// to find the value of one number raised to the power of another.
// (d) Write a program to print all the ASCII values and their equivalent
// characters using a while loop. The ASCII values vary from 0 to 255.
// (e) Write a program to print out all Armstrong numbers between 1 and
// 500. If sum of cubes of each digit of the number is equal to the
// number itself, then the number is called an Armstrong number. For
// example, 153 = ( 1 * 1 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 5 * 5 ) + ( 3 * 3 * 3 ).
// (f) Write a program for a matchstick game being played between the
// computer and a user. Your program should ensure that the
// computer always wins. Rules for the game are as follows:
//  There are 21 matchsticks.
//  The computer asks the player to pick 1, 2, 3, or 4 matchsticks.
//  After the person picks, the computer does its picking.
//  Whoever is forced to pick up the last matchstick loses the game.
// (g) Write a program to enter numbers till the user wants. At the end it
// should display the count of positive, negative and zeros entered.
// (h) Write a program to receive an integer and find its octal equivalent.
// (i) (Hint: To obtain octal equivalent of an integer, divide it continuously
// by 8 till dividend doesn’t become zero, then write the remainders
// obtained in reverse direction.)
// (j) Write a program to find the range of a set of numbers entered
// through the keyboard. Range is the difference between the smallest
// and biggest number in the list.
